# Platform compatibility policy

Ravenstash treats platform support as an installation, runtime, credential-storage,
update, and native-client contract. Binary support is gated on native artifacts
for the following targets:

| Operating system | Architectures | Artifact and install path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux with glibc 2.28+ | amd64, arm64 | signed APT package and portable archive |
| Linux with musl, including Alpine | amd64, arm64 | signed portable archive |
| macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon; macOS 15+ on Intel | Intel, Apple Silicon | checksummed portable archive; `install.sh` |
| Windows 11 | x64, ARM64 | checksummed ZIP; `install.ps1` |
| NixOS and Nix on Linux/macOS | x86_64, aarch64 | flake package |
| WSL2 | x86_64, aarch64 | matching Linux path |

Path-aware CI tests source on native Linux, macOS, and Windows runners and builds
one Ubuntu 20.04 baseline package when runtime or packaging inputs change. Nix
checks run only when Nix or dependency inputs change. The scheduled or manual
platform-certification workflow owns the exhaustive runtime matrix. One release
workflow builds isolated native artifacts from one exact source commit, assembles
one collision-free checksum inventory, creates keyless Sigstore provenance for
that complete inventory, and publishes those same bytes without rebuilding them.
Maintainers can also build selected targets from an exact commit as an unsigned,
seven-day Actions artifact without publishing.

Passing compatibility CI establishes that the source and release bundles
run on the target hosts. Public support begins only when the exact release artifacts
also pass integrity, installation, and clean-system certification. This prevents an
evaluated Nix output, a smoke-test bundle, or inherited Linux coverage from
being presented as a certified release for Nix, macOS, Windows, or WSL.

The glibc artifacts are built on Ubuntu 20.04. Portable amd64 smoke coverage includes
Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, and 26.04; Debian 12 and 13; Fedora 43 and 44; Rocky Linux 8 and
9; AlmaLinux 10; Amazon Linux 2023; openSUSE Leap 15.6 and 16.0; and Arch Linux.
Debian packages are published for both amd64 and arm64 in the same signed channel.

`RVS_GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional and can raise GitHub API limits for installer
downloads. It is passed in an HTTP authorization header and is never placed in a
child process argument.

## Credential storage

Interactive login selects an explicit store, a profile preference, the global
preference, or automatic discovery in that order. Automatic discovery tests a
disposable write/read/delete operation before browser authorization.

- macOS uses Keychain and Windows uses Credential Manager through Python Keyring.
- Linux desktops use Secret Service providers such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet.
- POSIX environments may use an initialized `pass` store or the encrypted Ravenstash
  vault. The vault's in-memory session agent uses a protected Unix socket and is not
  offered on Windows.
- `RVS_TOKEN` works without a credential store for CI and other headless use.
- Plaintext storage remains an explicitly acknowledged fallback and is never selected
  automatically.

Release certification covers locked, unlocked, and absent desktop keyrings separately
from headless sessions on real platform credential stores. Unit tests own provider
selection, credential-pair rollback, refresh locking, vault behavior, and plaintext
acknowledgement, but do not replace that host-level certification.

## Managed runtimes and native clients

Python runtime installation selects python-build-standalone assets for Linux glibc,
Linux musl, macOS, and Windows on both architectures. Java selects the corresponding
Temurin build. Node.js supports the official Linux glibc, macOS, and Windows archives.
On every musl system, including Alpine on amd64 and arm64, install Node.js through the
system package manager or another version manager; `rvs` resolves it from `PATH`.

Native pip, uv, twine, npm, Maven, Docker, Helm, and ORAS wrappers inherit terminal
I/O and use temporary credentials. Windows uses native executable suffixes and command
shims. If Windows policy prevents directory symlinks, the Docker context and plugin
metadata are copied into the temporary overlay instead.

The wrappers favor broad compatibility and do not reject a native client because it
is old. `rvs` warns below these advisory versions, then continues the command: pip
23.0, uv 0.4.30, Twine 4.0.2, npm 10.0, Maven 3.9.0, Docker 25.0.2, Helm 3.8.0,
and ORAS 1.1.0. Version detection is best-effort; an unavailable, failed, timed-out,
or unparseable probe does not block execution. The advisory levels identify clients
that predate relevant protocol controls, maintained upstream lines, or security fixes.

## Update boundaries

Every minor line is an independent compatibility series across APT, portable,
Homebrew, WinGet, and Nix installations. `rvs update` stays within the recorded
series; `rvs update --to SERIES` is required to cross that boundary. Portable
Linux, Alpine/musl, macOS, and Windows installations authenticate the signed
channel manifest and release checksum inventory before staging the native
bundle. POSIX activation switches one version pointer atomically. Windows uses a
detached helper after the running executable exits. Nix, Homebrew, and WinGet
remain package-manager-owned, so `rvs` delegates replacement instead of writing
into their stores. Homebrew and WinGet update in place within one series and
replace their versioned package with rollback for an explicit `--to` migration.
Their manifests are generated release artifacts; these package-manager paths are
not generally available until the manifests are published in the external
catalogs. The supported macOS and Windows installers therefore remain portable.
For tag-pinned Nix installs, `rvs` replaces only the
`ravenstash-cli` profile element with the selected immutable release tag and
attempts to restore the prior tag if installation fails.

## Additional platforms

FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux armv7, and Linux RISC-V remain source-compatible
evaluation targets rather than supported binary promises. Promoting one requires a
native, repeatable builder, secure credential-store behavior, signed installation and
updates, and the same packaged native-client certification. PyInstaller does not test
those BSD targets upstream, so a successful one-off build is insufficient.

Review this matrix at least quarterly and before changing the Python, PyInstaller,
cryptography, or keyring baselines. A target becomes supported only after its release
artifact and clean-system certification pass. Apple notarization and Windows
Authenticode are deferred; their absence must remain explicit in installation and
compatibility documentation.
